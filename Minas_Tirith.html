If you are not armed against the hords of orcs, protected against evil (and potentially many heavy weapons), you will not last a day in Middle-earth. Look in Minas Tirith inventory to find artifacts that will help you and your fellowship's endeavours.</p></div>

In fact, even Fëanor may not have been able to copy them as part of his essence went into their making. Their worth, in Tolkien's universe, was close to infinite, even to the Valar, as they were unique and irreplaceable. The Silmarils themselves are said to produce their own light, which comes from the Two Trees, but also to reflect the light of any other lights that come near them.</p></td>

			<p>The One Ring was a gold band with no jewels. The size of the Ring changed in order to fit its wearer. The Ring appeared to be completely plain with no markings, but when it was heated with fire an inscription was revealed on the outside and inside. The script was Elvish because fine lettering was required, but the language was the Black Speech. It read:</p><p><cite>Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul - Ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.</cite>.
