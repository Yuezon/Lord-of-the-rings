		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/elves.png');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Elves</h3>
		<p>The Elves (Quendi) were the first of the races of the Children of Ilúvatar, known also as the Firstborn for that reason. The Elves are distinguished from the other two races, the Men and the Dwarves, especially by the fact of their near immortality.</p>
		<p>Besides being considered more beautiful than men, Elves were also generally taller. Their hair colour varied; but the basic rules were that the Noldor generally had dark hair (brown or black), the Vanyar golden, and the Teleri silver or dark. Their eyes are usually described as grey or blue.</p>
		<p>Their lives were counted to begin at conception rather than birth, and though their minds sharpened much earlier in life than in the race of Men, their bodies grew more slowly. They were considered fully-grown at about a century. They married usually only once in their lives, and their children were often few and far-between.</p>
		<p>Their most distinguishing characteristic from the Mortal races was the fact that they were invulnerable to age or disease; unless they were killed by sword or sorrow, they would live to the end of the world. Unlike Men whose fëar (spirits) left Arda when their bodies died, Elves' fëar were bound to Arda until its ending. If an Elf's hröa (body) died, its fëa would be summoned to the Halls of Mandos, where the Valar could re-embody the Elf in a hröa that was identical to the Elf's previous hröa. However, if an Elf committed evil acts during their lifetime and refused to repent, the Valar could delay the Elf's re-embodiment, impose conditions on it, or refuse it altogether.An Elf could refuse the summons to Mandos or choose to remain disembodied, but the Elf's houseless fëa would still be unable to leave Arda.</p></div>

		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/human.jpg');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Men</h3>
		<p>Men were one of the Kindreds of the Children of Ilúvatar. Men were called the Secondborn (or the Second Kindred) by the Elves, their Elder brethren, because they were the last of all the incarnate races to come into being. Though they were born after the other sentient races, Men were destined to inherit and rule Middle-earth.</p>
		<p>The race of Men is the second race of beings created by Eru Ilúvatar. Because they awoke at the start of the First Age of the Sun, while the Elves awoke millennia before them, they are called the Secondborn (Quenya: Atani, Sindarin: Edain) by the Elves. Men awoke in a land located in the far east of Middle-earth called Hildórien. When the Sun rose for the first time in the far West, Men began to wander towards it, a journey which culminated in some of them reaching Beleriand centuries later.</p>
		<p>There is much evidence that, soon after their awakening, Morgoth came to Men and incited them to worship him and turn away from Ilúvatar, and that they complied. Though all were seduced by the Enemy, some Men repented and escaped; they were said to be the ancestors of the Edain.</p>
		<p>Men bear the so-called Gift of Men, mortality. Elves are immortal, in the sense that even if their bodies are slain, their spirits remain bound to the world, going to the Halls of Mandos to wait until they are released or the world ends. Elves are tied to the world for as long as it lasts. When Men die, they are released from Arda and the bounds of the world and have rest from its troubles. Ilúvatar also gifted Men with the freedom to shape their own future, being rather free from the designs of the Music of the Ainur. However, the influence of Morgoth has caused Men to fear their fate, and view Death as a Doom instead of a Gift.</p></div>

		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/dwarves.jpg');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Dwarves</h3>
		<p>The Dwarves, or Khazâd in their own tongue, were beings of short stature, often friendly with Hobbits although long suspicious of Elves. They were typically blacksmiths and stoneworkers by profession, unrivalled in some of their arts even by the Elves.</p>
		<p>Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves are not counted among the Children of Ilúvatar. Their creator was Mahal, known as Aulë the Smith. Aulë created the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, from whom all other Dwarves are descended, deep beneath an unknown mountain somewhere in Middle-earth. However, Aulë did not have the divine power to grant independent life to any creation, and the dwarves were bound to his will. Ilúvatar came and reprimanded Aulë, who confessed his desire to create more living things, but in repentance lifted his hammer to destroy the dwarves. Even as the blow was about to land, the dwarves cowered and begged for mercy, as Ilúvatar had taken pity and given true life to the creations of his child, including them in His plan for Arda. However, Ilúvatar did not wish them to wake before the Elves, whom he intended to be the first-born. Ilúvatar granted the Dwarves life, and therefore they are known as the Adopted Children of Ilúvatar, but he bade Aulë lay them to sleep in their chamber deep beneath the mountain, and they were to awake after the Awakening of the Elves.</p>
		<p>They were 4.5 - 5 feet (1.35 - 1.52 m) tall and their more distinctive characteristic was their beard which they have from the beginning of their lives, male and females alike; and which they shave only in shame.</p>
		<p>They had a tendency toward gold lust and committed their share of rash and greedy acts. Among these was the dispute over the Nauglamír, which led to the slaying of Elu Thingol and stirred up the initial suspicion between Elves and Dwarves to open hatred.</p>
		<p>Dwarves generally lived far from the sea and avoided getting on boats, as they disliked the sound of the ocean and were afraid of it.</p></div>

		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/ainur.jpg');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Ainur</h3>
		<p>The Ainur (singular Ainu) were divine spirits, the 'Holy Ones'. They were the first beings created by Ilúvatar, the 'order' of the Valar and Maiar, made before Eä.</p>
		<p>The Ainur were the first, and mightiest, beings created by Ilúvatar before the beginning of the World. The Ainur were the "offspring of Ilúvatar's thought", and each was given understanding only of that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which they came. The exception to this was Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur, who had a part of the gifts of all the others.</p>
		<p>Although all Ainur are made of the thought of Ilúvatar, in His mind some were siblings. Thus for instance, Melkor and Manwë were considered brothers.</p>
		<p>The Ainur were "kindled with the Flame Imperishable". Ilúvatar instructed them in music, until he brought them together to make the Music of the Ainur; the great song that created the Vision of Ilúvatar and ultimately the real World.</p>
		<p>The Ainur are immortal, angelic beings, nonetheless they do possess gender. Those who later descended to Arda took on common male and female forms to appear to the Elves in, and have an inherent male or female gender even when formless. This is because their gender is based on their being, which is independent of any physical form they may assume. But unlike the Children of Ilúvatar, they do not actually need hröar. Nevertheless, they can take tangible physical form called fana, but this is a manifestation of their spirit and they do not technically have bodies the way Elves and Men do. As such, an Ainu cannot quite be killed. However, Ainur's spirits can be weakened, in ways that hinder their ability to take shapes, influence the world, or even affect the world at all.</p></div>

	<h2>The heroes of this world</h2>

	<div class="race" style="background-image:url('images/wizard-bw.jpg');">
		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/wizard.jpg');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Wizards</h3>
		<p>The Order of Wizards (Q. Heren Istarion) was the title assigned to five Maiar in the Third Age of Middle-earth. The wizards were commonly known as the Istari (Quenya) and the Ithryn (Sindarin).</p>
		<p>Among Men it was initially assumed that the wizards were also men who by long and secret study had acquired great knowledge of lore and arts. However, as the Third Age passed it was marked that the wizards did not die and so Men began to believe that they were of Elven-kind. However, None except Elrond, Círdan, and Galadriel knew that, in actuality, the wizards, were Maiar, vassals of the Valar. These were sent by the Valar to help and assist the peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron as he gathered his forces during the Third Age.</p>
		<p>The five known Istari were:</p>
		<ul><li>Curumo, a Maia of Aulë</li>
		<li>Olórin, a Maia of Manwë and Varda (held by Círdan the Shipwright to be the wisest of the Order).</li>
		<li>Aiwendil, a Maia of Yavanna</li>
		<li>Alatar and Pallando, both Maiar of Oromë. Alatar and Pallando, also known as Ithryn Luin, the "Blue Wizards," went into the East and South, and do not appear in any of the main tales of Middle-earth.</li></ul>
		<p>In the northwest of Middle-earth Curumo became known as Saruman to Men and Curunír to Elves; Olórin was known as Gandalf to Men and Mithrandir to Elves; while Aiwendil became known as Radagast.</p>
		<p>They were clothed in the bodies of old men, restricting their powers so that they would only assist the peoples of Middle-earth and not seek domination like Sauron had, who was also a Maia. They were charged by the Valar to assist the people of Middle-earth through persuasion and encouragement, not force or fear. By inhabiting the bodies of Men they also became susceptible to all of the weaknesses of a physical body: they felt hunger, pain, greed, sorrow, joy, and all other emotions and pains of Men.</p>
		<p>They were immortal, and they aged only very slowly. However, their bodies could be killed: Gandalf was mortally wounded in his duel with the Balrog of Moria, and only through the intervention of Ilúvatar himself was he restored to his body.</p>
		<p>Very few of Middle-earth's inhabitants knew who the Wizards really were; the Istari did not share this information. Most believed they were Elves or wise Men (Gandalf represents this interpretation, meaning Wand-elf, because the Men who gave him the nickname believed he was an Elf). They attracted few questions due to their gentle nature and dislike of direct interference with other people's affairs. In spite of their specific and unambiguous goal, the Wizards were nevertheless capable of mortal feelings, thus Gandalf felt great affection for the Hobbits. On the other hand, they could feel negative mortal emotions like greed, jealousy, and lust for power. Saruman himself fell victim to these emotions, and it is hinted in an essay in Unfinished Tales that the Blue Wizards (see below) may have also fallen prey to these temptations during their journeys in the East.</p></div>

	<div class="race" style="background-image:url('images/hobbit-bw.jpg');">
		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/hobbit.jpg');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Hobbits</h3>
		<p>Hobbits were a small race that typically dwelt underground, believed to be related to Men. They played little role in history, save during the War of the Ring.</p>
		<p>Hobbits were between two and four feet tall ; with differences between male and femelle : about 3 feet 6 inches for males and seldom exceeded 3 feet for female). They were short legs, slightly pointed ears and furry feet with leathery soles, resulting in most never wearing shoes. Compared to the Dwarves they are a bit shorter and less stout or stocky. Early in their recorded history, Hobbits were divided in three kinds with different customs and temperament. The Stoors grew facial hair and had an affinity for water, boats and swimming and wore boots; the Fallohides were fair, tall and slim, an adventurous people, friendlier and more open to outsiders. Finally, the Harfoots were the most numerous and instituted the living in burrows. In later days the Harfoot traits became the "norm".</p>
		<p>Hobbits had a life span somewhat longer than Men of non-Númenórean descent, averaging between 90 and 100 years. The time at which a young hobbit "came of age" was 33. The two oldest-living recorded hobbits (except Gollum) were The Old Took (who reached the age of 130) and Bilbo Baggins (who surpassed him at 131).</p>
		<p>By nature they were of gentle disposition, neither cruel nor vindictive. Slow to quarrel, they never had been warlike, and never fought among themselves, nor hunted for sport; by the late Third Age the Shire-hobbits knew of weapons only as trophies or useless trinkets. However they were skilled with all kind of tools, as well as arms when there was a need; they were keen-eyed and used the bow well, and also the stones, successfully throwed against trespassing beasts.</p>
		<p>Throughout their history Hobbits had showed unparalleled skill, courage and also endurance and resistance in times of danger and terror. During their Wandering Days Hobbits demonstrated an easiness to adapt to the environments they visited and adopted the customs and languages of the peoples they were in contact with. In the Shire, they had settled with a closed and comfort-loving lifestyle; they were fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed, socializing and talking about genealogies. Hobbits also liked to drink ale in inns, and ate at least six meals a day when they could get them. Every Highday and after noon, Hobbits celebrated a small holiday with evening feasts.</p>
		<p>However, their hidden potentials resurfaced in difficult times; in the Long Winter, Gandalf admired their uncomplaining courage and pity for one another, thanks to which they survived.[9] Another example of Hobbitish hardiness and resistant nature, was Gollum, who despite using the One Ring for years, did not transform into a Wraith under the Ring's evil power (unlike the nine Mannish Kings).[10] These surprising Hobbit traits also were tested and proven during the Quest of Erebor and, most notably, the War of the Ring.</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Ents</h3>
		<p>The Ents were sentient, humanoid beings created at the request of Yavanna to protect the trees from other creatures, particularly Dwarves,[1] and thus were called "Shepherds of the Trees".</p>
		<p>The Ents were the most ancient living creatures surviving in Middle-earth in the Third Age. The Ents are a free people of their own kind, very similiar in origin to the Dwarves.[note 1] In fact, "when Yavanna discovered the mercy of Eru to Aule in the matter of the Dwarves, she besought Eru (through Manwe) asking him to give life" to the Ents, so that "the Ents were either souls sent to inhabit trees, or else that slowly took the likeness of trees owing to their inborn love of trees".</p>
		<p>Ents are the Shepherds of the Trees, as far as they were desired by Yavanna to protect the forests from Orcs, Dwarves and other perils.[5] The males were devoted to Oromë while the Entwives to Yavanna. They were created around the same time as the Elves. The Eldar loved to talk to everything and had tales of teaching the trees to talk. They gave them the desire to speak and taught them Elvish. Treebeard said the Elves "curing the Ents of their dumbness" was a great gift that could not be forgotten.</p>
		<p>Before even Morgoth returned to the North the first Ents were not as wise or strong as in later times. They developed a language, Entish, which was much simpler back then, and had very small knowledge of other languages.</p>

		<div class="race-image" style="background-image:url('images/dragons.png');"></div>
		<div class="race-text"><h3>Dragons</h3>
		<p>Dragons also known as the Great Worms were evil creatures seen mostly in the northern Middle-earth. They were greedy, cunning, seductive and malicious, probably a corruption devised by Morgoth with the aid of fire and sorcery sometime in the First Age.</p>
		<p>The Father of Dragons was Glaurung, a mighty wyrm with a fearful intelligence and a powerful hypnotic gaze. Glaurung played an integral part in the fate of the Children of Húrin. Among his many crimes were the destruction of the Elf-realm of Nargothrond and a spell cast upon Nienor which stripped her of her memory. This eventually led her to a disastrous reunion and marriage to her long-lost brother Túrin. When Nienor learned the truth of Glaurung's plot, she flung herself to her death. Glaurung was finally slain by Túrin, who afterward committed suicide in reaction to Glaurung's plot.</p>
		<p>The dragons were huge and longeval, with their lives spanning centuries. They shared a greed of treasure (especially gold), subtle intelligence, immense cunning, great physical strength, and their eyes and words had a hypnotic power called "dragon-spell". Those clever enough to avoid the spell never give direct information, but talked vaguely in riddles, since plainly refusing an answer would invite an immediate attack.</p>
		<p>While dragons were armoured with iron scales, they had a soft spot underneath, in the region of the chest, which could be pierced by blades or darts.</p>
		<p>The Urulóki (singular Urulokë, Fire-drakes) could breathe fire. It is not entirely clear whether the term "Urulóki" referred only to the first dragons such as Glaurung that could breathe fire but were wingless, or to any dragon that could breathe fire, and thus include Smaug.</p></div>

		<p>The Eagles were birds that served as messengers of Manwë. Among those were the Great Eagles, immense birds who were sentient, capable of speech, and often helped Men, Elves and Wizards in their quests to defeat evil. They were "devised" by Manwë Súlimo, King of the Valar, and were often called the Eagles of Manwë.</p>
		<p>They were sent from Valinor to Middle-earth to keep an eye on the exiled Ñoldor, and on their foe, the evil Vala Morgoth.</p>

		<p>The Mearas was the name given by the Rohirrim in their language for a race of exceptional horses.</p>
		<p>The Mearas were strong, wild, and intelligent. They would bear no man but the kings or princes of the Mark (with Gandalf as a notable exception). Their lifespan was as long as men.</p>
		<p>According to tradition, the ancestors of the Mearas were brought from the West by Béma. The horses of the Vales of Anduin were special. During the Angmar War, the Host of the West included noble Northmen riders, and when they landed at Lindon their horses were especially praised.</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Oathbreakers</h3>
		<p>The Oathbreakers, also known as the Dead Men of Dunharrow, were the shades of Men of the White Mountains.</p>
		<p>They were originally the Men of the Mountains. They were a Pre-Númenórean people that lived in the White Mountains during the Second Age and were related to the Dunlendings and to the folk of Haleth. They had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years before the foundation of Gondor.</p>
		<p>After Gondor was founded in the last years of the Second Age, their King swore allegiance to Isildur at the Stone of Erech on the Hill of Erech. When Sauron returned and grew in might, Isildur commanded the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their oath and fight beside Isildur against their ancient master, they broke their oath and refused to join the Last Alliance. As a reaction Isildur cursed them to remain without rest until their oath was fulfilled and foretold them that the war against Sauron would last for years uncounted and that they would be summoned again before the end. The Men of the Mountains fled from the wrath of Isildur and hid in secret places in the mountains, had no contact with other men and slowly dwindled. Afterwards the wraiths of the Sleepless Dead spread terror around the Hill of Erech and all places where the Men of the Mountains had lingered when they were still alive.</p></div>

		<p>The Balrogs, or Balrogath ("Balrog-kind") were Maiar corrupted by Morgoth during the creation of Arda, who cloaked themselves in shadow and flame and carried whips and swords. Famed Balrogs include Gothmog, slain by Ecthelion, and Durin's Bane, slain by Gandalf.</p>
		<p>Balrogs, also called Valaraukar, were originally Ainur created by Ilúvatar, probably those who joined Melkor during his discordance in the Music of the Ainur. After entering into Eä, they were Maiar, lesser spirits at the service of the Valar.</p>
		<p>They took the forms of demons with hearts of fire and whips of flame. Melkor gathered them about him after the fall of the Two Lamps and they dwelt in Utumno. When this fortress was destroyed by the Valar, they fled to the west and hid in the pits of Angband, awaiting their master's return.</p></div>

		<p>The Nazgûl (Black Speech: Ringwraiths, sometimes written Ring-wraiths), also known as the Nine Riders or Black Riders (or simply the Nine), were Sauron's "most terrible servants" in Middle-earth.</p>
		<p>Sometime during the Second Age (after year S.A. 1697) Sauron gave nine Rings of Power to powerful mortal Men. It is said that three of the Nine were lords of Númenor corrupted by Sauron, and one was a king among the Easterlings.</p>
		<p>For many years the bearers used the rings to gain great wealth, prestige and power, becoming "mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old". The effect of the rings caused their lives to be prolonged, and to see things of the Unseen. But over time their bodily forms faded until they became wraiths entirely, slaves under the domination of Sauron's One Ring.</p>
		<p>Given form only through the attire of black cloaks and hauberks of silver mail, their original form was completely gone and invisible to mortal eyes. Their hypnotic eyes could be plainly distinguished from their dark clothing, and in a rage they appeared in a hellish fire. Mortal men could not touch them (unless blessed by weapons or tools of the ancient Elves of the First Age or by the Dúnedain, such as the barrow-blade used by Merry on the Witch-king of Angmar). The Ringwraiths had many weapons, which included long swords of steel and flame, daggers with venomous properties, poisonous darts and black maces of great strength.</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Spiders</h3>
		<p>The Spiders were eight-legged creatures that captured their prey in intricate webs. Many spiders of Middle-earth reached a colossal size.</p>
		<p>There was a sinister side to the spiders of Middle-earth that entered it with the monstrous Ungoliant in the years before the First Age. A gigantic creature of spider-shape, it was she who destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor by sucking the light out of them, and escaped with Melkor into the lands of Middle-earth. Though Ungoliant disappeared into the far south, she left the northern lands infested with her offspring. During the First Age, the mountains of the Ered Gorgoroth were infested with these monsters, and became a place of dread.</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Orcs</h3>
		<p>Orcs were a race of humanoid creatures best known for their service as footsoldiers and slaves to the Dark Lords of Middle-earth. Even when not in thrall to an evil master, Orcs rarely if ever had non-violent interactions with Elves, Men, or Dwarves. They were known by many names by the various peoples of Middle-earth.</p>
		<p>It is certain that most Orcs were dependent on the Dark Lords in various ways: after the War of Wrath, the Orcs were confused and dismayed without Morgoth, and were easily scattered by their enemies. In the millennia after his defeat and banishment from Arda, they were without a leader and degenerated into small, quarrelsome tribes hiding in wild places, such as the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Angmar. Orcs remained a threat to travelers and isolated settlements, and when united could pose a great regional threat, but they could never amount to the force they were under Morgoth. Only when Sauron returned to power did they begin to reclaim their old power.</p>
		<p>Orcs were described as smaller in stature than Men on average, strong but crooked in frame and bow-legged. One "huge orc-chieftain" was described as "almost Man-high", but some must have been of a similar size to Hobbits (Frodo and Sam succeeded in disguising themselves as Orcs in Mordor). Their overall appearance varied: they had long arms and fanged mouths; Tolkien describes them as "swart" or "sallow", although one in Mordor is "black-skinned" and others are described generally as "black" (possibly not a reference to skin colour).</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Werevolves</h3>
		<p>Werewolves were servants of Sauron, fell beasts (wolves) inhabited by dreadful spirits that Sauron had imprisoned in their bodies.</p>
		<p>Werewolves were created (or a least corrupted from some other form) by Sauron, who was their master, and who took the shape of a great wolf himself at least once.</p>
		<p>The first werewolf was Draugluin, and the greatest was Carcharoth, the guardian of Angband, a descendant of Draugluin as all other werewolves were.</p>
		<p>In the Grey Annals it is told that "creatures that walked in wolf-shapes" entered Beleriand in the Valian Year 1330.</p>
		<p>Although not appearing as such in the known written records of Arda during the Second and Third Ages, Gandalf mentioned the werewolves as being among Sauron's servants in the late Third Age, along with orcs, trolls, wargs, and wraiths.</p></div>

		<div class="race-text"><h3>Trolls</h3>
		<p>TTrolls were large monsters of limited intellect. They were strong and vicious, but could not endure sunlight.</p>
		<p>Morgoth created or corrupted Trolls at the end of the First Age (twilight of the Elder Days). Their exact origins are unknown, though it is theorized by Treebeard that Trolls were "made in mockery of" Ents, similar to the theory that Orcs were a twisted parody of the Elves.</p>
		<p>Many Trolls died in the War of Wrath, but some survived and joined the forces of Sauron, the greatest surviving servant of Morgoth. In the Second and Third Ages, Trolls were among Sauron's most dangerous warriors and breeds of the various kinds of Trolls could be seen in several conflicts.</p></div>
