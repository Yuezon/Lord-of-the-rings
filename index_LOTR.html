	<h3>Ainulindalë: The Music of the Ainur</h3>

<div class="box01">
<p>This tale begins with <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span>'s creation of spirits of lesser power than him, yet of independent nature, named <span class="emphasis">the Ainur ("Holy Ones")</span>. <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> taught them music, and they sang before him, but each one alone. He showed them the most beautiful theme and asked them to sing together a <span class="emphasis">Great Music</span> in which their thoughts would be visible thanks to the <span class="emphasis">Flame Imperishable</span>. Thus began the <span class="emphasis">Music of the Ainur</span>. No music like this was sung again, though it is said that the <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> will sing a <span class="emphasis">Second Music</span> with the <span class="emphasis">Children of Ilúvatar</span>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Music, <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> sat and hearkened, but <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>, one of the greatest of the <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span>, in his pride broke the harmony. <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> then arose and a new theme began against the disturbance, and which <span class="emphasis">Manwë</span>, <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>'s brother, sang the leading part. Yet again, the harmony was broken with <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>'s violent song.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> began a third theme which the <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> could not comprehend. He then ceased the music and showed to the <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> the essence of what their song symbolized, the history of a whole world. This is known as the "<span class="emphasis">Vision of Ilúvatar</span>". The <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> became fascinated by it, and wished that <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> put it into being.</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> spoke "<span class="emphasis">Eä! Let these things Be!</span>". This command created the universe, and therefore the universe became known as <span class="emphasis">Eä</span>. Some of the <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> who possessed the greatest power entered into <span class="emphasis">Eä</span> and they were called the <span class="emphasis">Valar</span>, the "<span class="emphasis">Powers of the world</span>", as their mission was to form the world for the coming of the <span class="emphasis">Children of Ilúvatar</span>. Therefore they created a region which later was called <span class="emphasis">Arda, the Earth</span>, but <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span> attempted to take it for his own. However <span class="emphasis">Manwë </span>asked for the help of other <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span>, great or lesser. They descended to <span class="emphasis">Arda</span> and <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span> was forced to flee to other regions.</p>

<p>The <span class="emphasis">Valar</span> took the shapes of the <span class="emphasis">Children of Ilúvatar</span>, and their beauty and works increased <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>'s envy, so he also took visible form. The <span class="emphasis">First War</span> began in the world, in which <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span> tried to destroy all the works of the <span class="emphasis">Valar</span>, but at last the habitation of the <span class="emphasis">Children of Ilúvatar</span> was established.</p>
</div>

<h3>Valaquenta: Account of the Valar and Maiar according to the lore of the Eldar</h3>

<div class="box01">
<h5>Of the Valar</h5>
<p>Valar (the "Powers of Arda") is the name given to the chief <span class="emphasis">Ainur</span> following their descent to <span class="emphasis">Arda</span>. The Ainur were angelic spirits created by the supreme deity, <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span>. The most powerful of the Valar was <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>, who became corrupt, and ceased to follow the will of Ilúvatar. The fourteen remaining Valar continued in Ilúvatar's will.</p>
<p>The Ainur had either male or female forms, some were couples, while some were siblings in Ilúvatar's mind. Thus, there were seven male Valar, and seven female (<span class="emphasis">Valier</span>). Of the fourteen, those eight with the greatest might (called <span class="emphasis">Aratar</span>) were responsible for some attribute of life in <span class="emphasis">Arda</span> (e.g., crafts, mining, agriculture, etc.). The king of the Valar, and of all Arda was <span class="emphasis">Manwë</span>.</p>

<h5>Of the Maiar</h5>
<p>On their descent to Arda, the Valar, were followed by Ainur of lesser might, the <span class="emphasis">Maiar</span>, who were their subjects, students and assistants in governing Arda. The Valar had the ability to change their physical appearance, or to bear no shape at all.</p>

<h5>Of the Enemies</h5>
<p>Of the enemies are mentioned Melkor, <span class="emphasis">Sauron</span> and the <span class="emphasis">Balrogs</span>, spirits who were seduced by him and fell into hate.</p>
</div>


<h3>Quenta Silmarillion: The History of the Silmarils</h3>

<div class="box01">
<p>After the Valar's entrance, Arda was still lifeless and had no distinct geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by two lamps: one in the continent's north, and one in the south. However the lamps were destroyed by the vicious <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>. Arda was again darkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the perfect symmetry of Arda's surface. Two main continents were created that are of concern to the story: <span class="emphasis">Aman</span> on the far West, and <span class="emphasis">Middle-earth</span> to the East, over the Great Ocean.</p>

<p>Following this, Melkor hid himself from the Valar in an enormous fortress, <span class="emphasis">Utumno</span>. He also surrounded himself with horrible beasts, many of them <span class="emphasis">Maiar</span> in the form of fell animals, known as Balrogs. <span class="emphasis">Balrogs</span> were to remain his most faithful servants and soldiers ever after.</p>

<p>The Valar then made for themselves a home at the utmost West, upon Aman. Then the Valar began to reshape Arda yet again, making it habitable and preparing it for the coming of the <span class="emphasis">Children of Ilúvatar</span>: <span class="emphasis">Elves</span> and <span class="emphasis">Men</span>. However everywhere they went, Melkor followed them spoiling the fruit of their labour and damaging their achievements. Thus, all of Arda was marred by Melkor's anger, envy and lust of power.</p>

<p>Utumno did not protect Melkor, however. He was taken prisoner and sentenced to three ages (about 9,000 years) of imprisonment. Utumno was laid bare; but all its evil was not destroyed. Before Melkor was taken captive, Arda witnessed the <span class="emphasis">Awakening of the Elves</span>, the first-born Children of Ilùvatar. Elves are described as anthropomorphic beings, who, however, are immortal and possess many virtues (beauty, health, ability to communicate with nature), beyond the share of Men. The Elves were met by the Valar and invited to join them in the West; however Melkor managed to reach some of the Elves even earlier. It is said that from them he bred the hideous race of <span class="emphasis">Orcs</span> whom both he and his follower <span class="emphasis">Sauron</span> used as soldiers.</p>

<p>Some of the Elves refused to go westward. They became known as the <span class="emphasis">Avari</span>. Two houses of the Elves, the <span class="emphasis">Vanyar</span> and the <span class="emphasis">Noldor</span> crossed the <span class="emphasis">Great Sea</span> with the help of the Valar. A third house, called the <span class="emphasis">Teleri</span> lingered on the eastern shore of the Great Sea and in the west of Middle-earth. Eventually many of the Teleri crossed the Great Sea, but some Teleri remained in Middle Earth. The groups of Teleri that remained are termed <span class="emphasis">Sindar</span>, <span class="emphasis">Nandor</span> and <span class="emphasis">Falathrim</span>.</p>

<p>At some time between the imprisonment of Melkor and his release, the Valar created the Two Trees, <span class="emphasis">Laurelin</span> and <span class="emphasis">Telperion</span>, which filled Valinor with light.</p>

<p>There arose a mighty Elf among the house of Noldor, named <span class="emphasis">Fëanor</span>. Fëanor was skilled in crafts and his greatest achievement has been the making of three wonderful jewels, the <span class="emphasis">Silmarils</span>. The Silmarils contained the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.</p>

<p>By that time Melkor's captivity was over. However he returned to evil quickly. Through a vicious design he managed to destroy the Two Trees and to steal the Silmarils. Then he fled eastward, to the <span class="emphasis">Middle-earth</span>.</p>

<p>The furious Fëanor followed Melkor (whom he re-named <span class="emphasis">Morgoth</span>). This was done against the will of the Valar, and during Fëanor's flight he slew many of the Teleri, over their refusal to lend him their ships (<span class="emphasis">First Kinslaying</span>). For this he and his followers were forbidden to approach Aman ever again. However, Fëanor ignored this punishment and managed to cross the Great Ocean eastward. There he joined with the Sindar, who had been in Middle-earth all along. Years after this flight, in order to diminish the darkness, the Valar launched the Sun, so that it would dissolve Melkor's shadows.</p>

<p>Morgoth, having returned to Middle-earth, fortified his previous secondary fortress, <span class="emphasis">Angband</span> with its capital at <span class="emphasis">Thangorodrim</span>. From there he waged war upon the Sindar. However, with the help of the Noldor who had just crossed the Ocean, the first onslaught of Morgoth's attack was thrown off.</p>

<p>Following this, the Noldor settled with the Sindar in the West of Middle-earth, known as <span class="emphasis">Beleriand</span>. They adopted the <span class="emphasis">Sindarin</span> language instead of their native <span class="emphasis">Quenya</span>. This period of relative peace and stability was short-lived (at least by the Elves' standards). One of the first victims of this war was Fëanor himself. As time passed, Morgoth gathered more and more force.</p>

<p>Three hundred years after the coming of the Noldor to Beleriand, Middle-earth witnessed the awakening of Men, the Secondborn (or the Followers). Most of them allied with the Elves in order to defend Beleriand from Morgoth. However neither Elvish skill, nor Mannish resolve succeeded in defying him. One after another, the domains of Elves and Men were destroyed and filled with evil.</p>

<p>At last, more than five centuries after the flight of the Noldor, <span class="emphasis">Eärendil</span>, the son of an Elf-woman and a Man set sail to the West with the only Silmaril that his ancestors managed to recover. He was allowed to land in Aman, and to plead with the Valar for mercy towards the Elves and Men.</p>

<p>The Valar agreed to pardon the Noldor. They set out to fight Morgoth and were victorious. Morgoth was expelled from Arda. However during the conflict, the very continent of Beleriand was destroyed and sunk, thus forming a new shoreline for Middle-earth, hundreds of miles to the east.</p>

<p>The Valar offered Elves their forgiveness and the right to come to Aman. Many of them did indeed leave Middle-Earth, weary of centuries of warfare against the ever-growing evil. The tribes of Men that helped the Elves were given a whole island of their own, on which they founded the kingdom of <span class="emphasis">Númenor</span>.</p>

<p>Eärendil, because he possessed both mortal and immortal heritage, was given the opportunity to choose his fate; a gift that was also given to all of his descendants who were born of an immortal parent. His Silmaril became a bright star. One Silmaril was sunk in the water of the Great Ocean, and the third was lost in the depths of the Earth. Thus other than the sun and moon above, no trace remained on Middle-earth of the <span class="emphasis">Two Trees of Valinor</span>; but their influence lives on in the elements: air, water and fire/earth.</p>

</div>


<h3>Akallabêth: The Downfall of Númenor</h3>

<div class="box01">
<p>At the end of the <span class="emphasis">First Age</span>, the <span class="emphasis">Edain</span>, who alone among the race of Men were loyal defenders of the <span class="emphasis">Elves</span> during their war against <span class="emphasis">Morgoth</span>, were given a new land of their own in reward for their efforts, free from the troubles and sadness of <span class="emphasis">Middle-earth</span>. It was located in the middle of the <span class="emphasis">Great Sea</span>, between the western shores of Middle-earth and the eastern shores of <span class="emphasis">Aman</span>, where the <span class="emphasis">Valar</span> lived.</p>

<p>The Men of <span class="emphasis">Númenor</span> were <span class="emphasis">forbidden</span> by the Valar to sail westward so far that they could no longer see the island, so the majority of their voyaging was eastward and in time they returned to the shores of Middle-Earth. The Númenóreans established remote colonies in Middle-earth and made contact with the <span class="emphasis">Men of Middle-earth</span> and taught them many crafts and skills. They made alliance with <span class="emphasis">Gil-galad</span> and the Elves and aided them in the <span class="emphasis">war</span> against Sauron where he was defeated by the power of the Númenóreans.</p>

<p>Over time many began to speak openly of their envy of the Eldar's immortality and in defiance of the Ban. The people of Númenor became split between the <span class="emphasis">King's Men</span>, those loyal to the King and prone to oppose the restraints upon Númenor, and the <span class="emphasis">Faithful</span>, those who remained true to their friendship with the Eldar and loyalty to the Valar. During this time, the long life of the Númenóreans began to decrease as the Shadow rose. Their joy for life and good will departed, but their power increased.</p>
	
<p>Sauron re-emerged to challenge the power of Númenor in Middle-earth and their colonies along the shores were assailed by him and his armies. The king, <span class="emphasis">Ar-Pharazôn</span>, responded and came with a great host to Middle-earth and bade Sauron to come before him and swear fealty. To the surprise of many, Sauron did as he was asked. But the King was not content with his show of obedience, and brought Sauron back to Númenor as a hostage. Sauron gave the impression that this was against his will, but in truth it was exactly what he wanted. Sauron exploited his power to corrupt the King to his will. Soon he became his adviser, and most of the Númenóreans obeyed his will and turned to the worship of Morgoth.</p>

<p>Sauron convinced the King, who was now in his twilight years, to assail Aman in order to gain immortality. Thus Ar-Pharazôn led his <span class="emphasis">Great Armament</span> and landed on Aman. However, as this was done, the Valar appealed to <span class="emphasis">Eru Ilúvatar</span> and he destroyed the Great Armament. Ar-Pharazôn and his host were buried under hills, and the whole of Númenor sank under the Great Sea. <span class="emphasis">Arda</span> was made spherical and Aman was put beyond it, out of the reach of mortal Men.</p>

<p>Just a few people still uncorrupted by Sauron managed to escape the catastrophe; they fled Númenor by ship. This group of Faithful Númenóreans was led by <span class="emphasis">Elendil</span> the Tall and his two sons, <span class="emphasis">Isildur</span> and <span class="emphasis">Anárion</span>. They landed in Middle-earth, where the followers of Elendil established two kingdoms which came to be known as the realms of Exile: <span class="emphasis">Gondor</span> in the south, and <span class="emphasis">Arnor</span> in the north. Some of the King's Men, enemies of Elendil, who were in Middle-earth at the time of the <span class="emphasis">Downfall</span> established other realms in exile to the south; of these the Haven of Umbar was the chief. Sauron, although greatly diminished and bereft of shape, had survived the Downfall and returned to Middle-earth to continue troubling its inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<h3>Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age</h3>

<div class="box01">
<p>The Elves of Eregion forged many Rings of Power. But Sauron had deceived them, for he made the One Ring for himself, which was the master of the rest.</p>

<p>However Sauron's plan failed: the Elves discovered his plot and discarded their Rings until they could be shielded from his influence. Sauron then waged war upon the Elves. During the war, many Elves were killed and the kingdom in <span class="emphasis">Eregion</span> destroyed. Sauron captured all the Rings of Power except the Three and he gave seven of them to Dwarves and nine to Men. But Sauron feared to assail <span class="emphasis">Lindon</span> as the Men of <span class="emphasis">Númenor</span> aided <span class="emphasis">Gil-galad</span>, the mighty elvenking. Throughout the <span class="emphasis">Black Years</span> or <span class="emphasis">Days of Flight</span> Sauron gathered to him all the evil things of Days of Morgoth. Hundreds of years later, the Men of Númenor decided to capture Sauron to demonstrate their might. As it is described in <span class="emphasis">Akallabêth</span>, Sauron was brought to Númenor as a slave; however, he soon corrupted most Númenóreans, encouraging them to replace their traditional reverence for <span class="emphasis">Ilúvatar</span> with worship of <span class="emphasis">Melkor</span>, Sauron's previous master. Under Sauron's influence, the Númenóreans decided to challenge the <span class="emphasis">Valar</span> by invading <span class="emphasis">Aman</span>. As a result, Númenor was destroyed and sank beneath the waves.</p>

<p>Only a few survivors left Númenor before it was too late, and led by <span class="emphasis">Elendil</span> the Tall and his two sons <span class="emphasis">Isildur</span> and <span class="emphasis">Anárion</span>, they had settled in <span class="emphasis">Middle-earth</span>. They created realms that were governed in Númenórean style: Elendil ruled over <span class="emphasis">Arnor</span> in the North, and Isildur and Anarion ruled together in the great country of <span class="emphasis">Gondor</span> in the South. However, Sauron survived the disaster, and although he had lost his fair appearance, both he and his One Ring returned safely to his stronghold of old in the land of <span class="emphasis">Mordor</span>.</p>

<p>Years passed, and Sauron, who had renewed his might, decided to attack the new realms while they were still weak. His onslaught failed, however, Elendil, his sons, and the Elven kings fought back. For many years the great coalition (The <span class="emphasis">Last Alliance of Elves and Men</span>, as it became known) besieged Mordor. At last the host broke through to Sauron's fortress <span class="emphasis">Barad-dûr</span>. Gil-galad and Elendil wrestled with Sauron and were slain; however, they managed to defeat Sauron. Isildur, Elendil's son approached Sauron's body and cut off his finger with the One Ring. In vain <span class="emphasis">Elrond</span> and <span class="emphasis">Círdan</span> tried to convince Isildur to destroy the ring in the fire of <span class="emphasis">Mount Doom</span> where it was made. But Isildur took it for his own and declared that it was his and his folk's, a consolation after the enormous loss of the war (besides the death of Elendil, his father, another of those who perished was his brother Anárion, who was killed during the siege of Barad-dûr). Thus began the <span class="emphasis">Third Age</span> of Middle-earth.</p>
	
<p>Isildur himself died soon in a sudden ambush by a band of <span class="emphasis">Orcs</span> near <span class="emphasis">Gladden Fields</span>, and the Ring that had betrayed him was lost in the great river <span class="emphasis">Anduin</span>. Heirs of royal blood were chosen to lead Arnor and Gondor. For a millennium, both realms enjoyed relative freedom and prosperity. However afterwards, Arnor became subject to attacks from the north-eastern kingdom of <span class="emphasis">Angmar</span>. More and more people fled from the North, and although Angmar was defeated by the beginning of the third millennium of Third Age, Arnor was no more. Its people were scattered, and its royalty decreased in number and fame; however they remained true to their Númenórean descent. They became the <span class="emphasis">Rangers of the North</span>, protecting the paths of the North from the menace that came from the East.</p>
	
<p>As for Gondor, it prospered for much of the Third Age. However in the beginning of its third millennium, this began to change. Gondor was assailed by Orcs and Men from the nearby Mordor. For a long time, no one suspected that the same force that had driven the attacks upon Arnor was now fighting Gondor.</p>
	
<p>A thousand years earlier, several <span class="emphasis">Wizards</span> had come to the land: <span class="emphasis">Saruman</span>, <span class="emphasis">Radagast</span>, <span class="emphasis">Gandalf</span>, and two <span class="emphasis">Blue Wizards</span>. Although it was unknown to the peoples of Middle-earth, they were emissaries from the West, sent on behalf of the <span class="emphasis">Valar</span> to help them obtain their freedom. For many centuries they were silent, and little was done by them apart from observation and counsel. However as the times darkened, they decided to take action against a mysterious dark force which seemed to dwell in the fortress of <span class="emphasis">Dol Guldur</span> amidst the forest of <span class="emphasis">Mirkwood</span>. During the attack, the force fled to <span class="emphasis">Mordor</span> and was revealed as Sauron, who was thought to have perished. And in the same year, the One Ring was found.</p>
	
<p>Sauron made war on Middle-earth again, but Frodo the Hobbit went to <span class="emphasis">Mount Doom</span> and destroyed the Ring, defeating Sauron. After this, it was made clear that Gandalf bore the Red Ring, <span class="emphasis">Narya</span>.</p>
