In fact, the friends you need should be trustworthy and dependable. Here are a few candidates for the role.</div>

			<h3>Frodo Baggins</h3>
			
			<p>Frodo Baggins was a hobbit of the Third Age, the most famous of all Hobbits in the histories for his leading role in the <span class="emphasis">Quest of the Ring</span>. During this epic quest, he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom and there destroyed it, giving him renown like no other Halfling throughout Middle-earth. He is also peculiar for being, as a Ring-bearer, one of the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to Aman, there to die in peace.</p>
			<p>Frodo, the child of the respectable Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, was born on 22 September of S.R. 1368. After his parents died in a boating accident, Frodo went to live in Brandy Hall with his mother’s relatives, the Brandybucks. He grew up under the guardianship of the Master of Buckland Rorimac "Goldfather" Brandybuck, who was his uncle. Frodo was a bit of a troublesome lad; he was once caught stealing mushrooms from Farmer Maggot, who in return thrashed Frodo and set his three dogs to chase Frodo from Bamfurlong to Bucklebury Ferry.</p>
			<p>Frodo stayed in Buckland until his "uncle" Bilbo adopted him and took him in to live at Bag End, Bilbo's house in Hobbiton. He enjoyed life with his "queer" uncle Bilbo, with whom he shared the same birthday; Bilbo taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the elvish tongue.Frodo was the only one Bilbo allowed to read his memoirs he was writing. Bilbo made Frodo his heir, frustrating the attempts of the disagreeable Sackville-Bagginses, who coveted the estate of Bag End.</p>
			<p>He lived in peace and respectability for seventeen years, when Gandalf returned with the dreadful revelation that the "magic ring" was really the One Ring of Sauron, a thing of evil power thousands of years old. Furthermore, the Dark Lord was now aware of its survival, and would be searching for it, as Gollum had now revealed under torture that it was to be found in the Shire. After a long discussion and a test by fire, the two agreed that Frodo would have to leave the Shire for his own safety and Samwise Gamgee the gardener would go with him. Gandalf recommended Rivendell as a destination, as the road was likely safe and the haven good. He told Frodo to take the alias Underhill abroad. Frodo was reluctant, but bought a house in Crickhollow as an excuse to head east.</p>
			<p>Frodo carried a small Elven sword called Sting and wore a coat of Dwarven mail made of mithril under his clothes, both given to him by Bilbo. In Lothlórien, Galadriel gave him an Elven cloak that helped him blend in with his natural surroundings and a phial carrying the light of the Star of Eärendil to aid him on his quest.</p>

			<h3>Samwise Gamgee</h3>
			<p>Samwise Gamgee, commonly known as Sam, was Frodo Baggins' servant and the only original member of the Fellowship of the Ring to remain with him to the very end of the journey to Mount Doom.</p>
			<p>Samwise lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, better known as the "Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. Sam's mother was Bell Goodchild; he had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.</p>
			<p>A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. He helped his Gaffer tending the garden of Bag End and was taught the art of rope making by his grandfather and his uncle Andy. In his work at Bag-End, he was acquainted with Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo taught him letters, and nurtured love for Elves, poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of. This set him apart from the beginning, to the Gaffer's dismay. Sam often wandered outside Hobbiton and knew well the area twenty miles around.</p>
			<p>He eavesdropped at the discussion discussion between Frodo and Gandalf while working at the garden of Bag End. It was when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is Sauron's One Ring, and on the mention that Frodo must leave the Shire, Sam choked. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity. Sam begged Gandalf not to turn him into anything "unnatural". Sam then immediately asked to be taken to see Elves when they went away. Gandalf decided to make Sam Frodo's first companion.</p>
			<p>Sam has brown eyes. At some points his hands are described as brown. This could indicate he belongs to the Harfoots, as they are described as having browner skin than the Fallohides, to which breed Merry, Pippin and Frodo belong. Or it could simply be a tan from years of working outside.</p>

			<h3>Meriadoc Brandybuck</h3>
			<p>Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck, called The Magnificent, was a Hobbit, the son of Saradoc Brandybuck. He was one of the four Hobbits in the Fellowship of the Ring and later became the Knight of Rohan, participating in the slaying of the Witch-king of Angmar alongside Lady Éowyn.</p>
			<p>Merry was an heir to the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall. After his participation to the War of the Ring, he eventually inherited the Mastership in Buckland after his father's death.</p>
			<p>Meriadoc was the son of Saradoc and Esmeralda. Claiming descent from Gorhendad Oldbuck, he also had Tookish blood through his mother, and also his father's grandmother, Mirabella Took. He was also first cousins with Peregrin Took. With him they wandered in the Marish and were friends of Farmer Maggot.</p>
			<p>Around T.A. 3000 Merry witnessed a strange scene: he saw Bilbo Baggins becoming invisible in order to avoid a meeting with the Sackville-Bagginses. Startled, he got through the hedge and walked along the field inside, and watched as Bilbo reappeared, and put a glint of gold in his pocket. This made teenage Meriadoc very curious and he even looked into Bilbo's private diary.</p>
			<p>He was a good friend of Frodo Baggins, who eventually became the Ring-bearer, and Peregrin Took, a young relative. He was one of the few (if any) who saw Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle, actually use the One Ring. He also managed to read, at least in part, Bilbo's book: There and Back Again, where he learned about the Ring.</p>

			<h3>Peregrin Took</h3>
			<p>Peregrin "Pippin" Took was a Hobbit, the son of Paladin Took. He was the youngest of the four Hobbits in the Fellowship of the Ring, being in his tweens, but grew up quickly and eventually became a Knight of Gondor. Elrond, at least, seemed to doubt his capability for the quest, but Pippin proved to be a loyal and courageous friend.</p>
			<p>After the War of the Ring, Peregrin eventually inherited the Thainship in the Shire after his father's death.</p>
			<p>He was one of the Conspirators, who knew the truth behind Frodo's mysterious behaviour and reasons for departure of the Shire. Along with Merry, Fatty Bolger and Folco Boffin they helped Frodo pack his household and send carts to Crickhollow; they celebrated together his last birthday in Bag End, and stayed with Frodo and Samwise Gamgee when the others left for Buckland.</p>
			<p>Pippin and Merry were heroes, and would tell all the other hobbits the stories of their travels to far-off lands. They would often go out abroad wearing their armour (Pippin had remained a Knight of Gondor) and people thought they were lordly - a position likely enforced by their extraordinary height caused by the Ent-draughts (they were at least 4'5'' tall - taller than Bullroarer Took).</p>

			<h3>Aragorn</h3>
			<p>Aragorn II was the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen. He was the last Chieftain of the Dúnedain and a direct descendant through many generations of Isildur, the last High King of both Arnor and Gondor. Aragorn would become the greatest Man of his time, leading the Men of the West against Sauron's forces, helping to destroy the One Ring, and reuniting the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.</p>
			<p>In the year T.A. 3001, as a now revealed Sauron continued to regain power in Mordor, Aragorn began assisting Gandalf in his search for news of Gollum. Gandalf suspected that the ring Bilbo Baggins found near Gollum's lake was in fact the One Ring. In T.A. 3007, he briefly returned to Eriador where he visited his mother for the last time. She died before that year's spring.</p>
			<p>When Aragorn returned to his area, the Elves who followed Gildor Inglorion told Aragorn the Black Riders had been seen, and Gandalf had been missing and there were no messages from him. Aragorn and his Rangers kept watch over the border of the Shire and the East Road waiting for sight of Frodo but there was no news of them leaving Buckland.</p>
			<p>Aragorn again amazed the rest of the Fellowship by his apparent closeness to the people of Lothlórien, and his friendship with Celeborn and Galadriel. At their departure, Galadriel offered him the Elfstone as a wedding gift from the family of the Elven bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen. It was worn by Aragorn ever after and from that he later took the name Elessar.</p>
			<p>Aragorn ruled the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until year 120 of the Fourth Age.</p>

			</div>

			<h3>Legolas</h3>
			<p>Legolas was a Sinda Elf, the prince of the Woodland Realm of Mirkwood. His grandfather Oropher was of the Sindar of Doriath, and his father Thranduil was king of Mirkwood (Greenwood the Great). His exact date of birth is not known, nor are his earliest exploits, but his most important recorded role is that which he played in the War of the Ring, during which he was the Elven representative in the Fellowship of the Ring. His Elven giftings, such as superior sight and hearing, lightness of foot, and skilled archery, were valuable assets to his eight companions.</p>
			<p>Legolas was counted unusual for his strong friendship with a Dwarf, Gimli son of Glóin. Such a friendship was rare between the two races, on account of the long-standing grievances between Dwarves and Elves dating back to the Elder Days. Also, friendship between these two was unlikely because of the grudge between their two particular houses for the rough treatment given Glóin and the rest of Thorin Oakenshield's company by Thranduil on an earlier occasion.</p>
			<p>Legolas showed almost irrepressible cheerfulness throughout the journey, passing through Caradhras and even the Paths of the Dead without hesitation or complaint. His youthful nature can be seen from the mocking way he treated the "strong men" on Caradhras, whom Boromir (excluding Legolas) had said could forge a way out through the snow. He is perhaps most remembered for his friendship with Gimli the Dwarf, and it was during this friendship that we see his faithfulness, and also his love of beauty. Gimli's words moved him when the dwarf spoke of the Glittering Caves.</p>

			<h3>Gimli</h3>
			<p>Gimli was a dwarf of the House of Durin who became famous as the only Dwarven member of the Fellowship of the Ring.</p>
			<p>Gimli was born in the Blue Mountains during a time of exile for the Durin's Folk, about a century after the tragic destruction of Dale and the Sacking of Erebor by Smaug the Golden. His father was Glóin, a direct descendant of King Náin II and, through him, of Durin the Deathless. His father joined Thorin and Company in their quest to reclaim the Kingdom under the Mountain, but Gimli was forbidden because he was too young: only 62 at the time.</p>
			<p>Gimli, as the only young dwarf seen at the council of Elrond, was appointed as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. He alone of the company wore a mail-shirt, and carried a broad-bladed axe. He quickly distinguished himself in the company by declaring that he "needed no map" and naming the Misty Mountains individually by their Khuzdul names, inspiring the comment from Sam: "A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!"</p>

			<h3>Gandalf</h3>
			<p>Gandalf was one of the five Istari sent to Middle-earth by the Valar in the Third Age. In Valinor he was known as Olórin. Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of Sauron in T.A. 3019, chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. Gandalf was originally robed in grey, and second to Saruman in the Order of wizards. After his fall in Moria, Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head of the Order, robed in white. Gandalf was noteworthy for his keen interest in Hobbits.</p>
			<p>The wisest of the Maiar, Gandalf was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur. At the beginning of Time, he was amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he was known as Olórin and lived in Lórien. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda.</p>
			<p>The first description of Gandalf is preserved in the initial pages of The Hobbit, written in the early 1930s. Gandalf's fame is alluded to even before his physical description ("Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion"), while the protagonist's ("unsuspecting Bilbo") impression is that of: an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.</p>
			<p>Gandalf demonstrated extensive knowledge of the land and an assortment of magical abilities from trivial to essential. For example he would use his powers for entertainment, by blowing glowing smoke rings that moved around a room at his direction, and Bilbo Baggins remembered him for his fantastic fireworks displays. He created blinding flashes and other pyrotechnics to distract the goblins of the Misty Mountains, aiding the dwarves in their escape from Goblin-town. On the eastern slopes, he turned pine cones into flaming projectiles that threw hot sparks and started fires that would not easily go out. He was also able to come and go from the presence of Thorin and Company without being noticed.</p>

			<h3>Boromir</h3>
			<p>Boromir was the eldest son of Denethor II and Finduilas and the older brother of Faramir.</p>
			<p>Boromir was beloved by his father and was like him in face and pride, but in little else. Boromir's temperament was similar to King Eärnur of old, he took no wife and was more interested in arms and warfare. He cared little for lore, save for the tales of old battles.</p>
			<p>He was a man of great strength and valour. He had a fair and noble face, dark haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.</p>
			<p>He was one of the nine walkers who made up the Fellowship of the Ring.</p>
			<p>Boromir was born in T.A. 2978, five years before his brother Faramir. Between the brothers there was great love, and had been since childhood, when Boromir was the helper and protector of Faramir. He was only ten years old when their mother Finduilas died, and after her death their father became more grim and silent than before.</p>
			<p>Boromir grew to be a valorous warrior, interested in arms, warfare and tales of old battles and would serve as a commander to the military of Gondor.</p>
